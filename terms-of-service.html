        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Anime Hangama is a fan-based platform that operates as a search engine or directory for anime content. We do not host, store, or upload any copyrighted material on our servers. Our Service indexes publicly available links from the internet and organizes them in a user-friendly manner. The content to which we link is hosted on third-party websites, and we have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites.</p>

        <h2>3. Monetization and Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>To support the maintenance and operation of our Service, some of the outbound links on Anime Hangama may be routed through third-party link shortening services (such as GPLinks or similar platforms). When you click on these links, you may be redirected to an intermediate page that displays advertisements before you reach the final destination.</p>
        <p>By using our Service, you acknowledge and agree to this practice. We are not responsible for the advertisements shown or the content on these intermediate pages. Your interactions with these services are subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>

            <li>Violate any local, state, national, or international law.</li>
            <li>Engage in any activity that is harmful, threatening, abusive, or harassing.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our servers or any associated systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with any third-party websites you visit through our Service.</p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property and DMCA</h2>
        <p>We respect the intellectual property of others. All copyrights and trademarks for the anime, manga, and other promotional materials are held by their respective owners. Our practice of indexing links is conducted under the belief that it constitutes "fair use" under copyright law.</p>
