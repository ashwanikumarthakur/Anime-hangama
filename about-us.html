        <h1>About Anime Hangama</h1>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Anime Hangama, a dedicated space for anime enthusiasts around the world. Our mission is simple: to make the vast and vibrant world of anime easily accessible to every fan. We believe that great stories deserve to be found, and we are passionate about creating a platform that helps you discover your next favorite series.</p>
        
        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>Anime Hangama operates as a comprehensive search engine and directory for anime content. We understand that finding where to watch anime can sometimes be a challenge, with content scattered across numerous platforms. Our service scours the public internet to index and organize links to anime, presenting them in a clean, user-friendly interface.</p>
        
        <p>It is important to understand that **we do not host any of the video content ourselves**. Our platform is a curated collection of publicly available links, much like any other search engine. We provide the map; the destinations are managed by third-party websites.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to the Community</h2>
        <p>We are a fan-driven project, built by fans, for fans. We are committed to respecting the creators, studios, and distributors who bring these incredible stories to life. We encourage all our users to support the official releases of anime whenever and wherever possible.</p>
        
        <p>We are always looking for ways to improve your experience. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. Thank you for being a part of the Anime Hangama community!</p>
